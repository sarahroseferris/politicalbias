Left,https://canadafactcheck.ca,The World Health Organization had a plan for the coronavirus but much of the world ignored it.,it is increasingly obvious that if there was a set of globally enforceable rules regarding public health practices that all nations had to implement at the first signs of a possible pandemic  we would not be facing the catastrophic health and economic crisis we are facing today with the coronavirus what most people don t know is that in    the world health organization  w h o  put in place a set of practices to prevent a coronavirus type pandemic  the strategy called for increased powers for the w h o  to co ordinate a global fight against infectious diseases the present crisis shows that the w h o  strategy failed why  because political leaders in many nations  notably  but certainly not only  china  either bullied the w h o  into delaying the declaration of the coronavirus as a public health emergency  or ignored w h o  guidelines on how to stop the pandemic in other words  in a globalized world where millions travel outside their home countries every year  the organization whose purpose it is to protect world health has little clout over the jurisdictions that actually deliver public health services the lesson  in a globalized economy  we need a strong international public health organization that can force countries to implement agreed upon public health practices in a timely manner in other words  a globalized economy requires globalized public health this post concludes with some steps that can be taken to greatly empower the world health organization so that it has the clout to effectively fight pandemics such as the coronavirus why we need the globalization of public health the tragedy of the current coronavirus pandemic is that the world health organization  w h o  saw this coming as did public health officals around the world  in    the w h o  set out to develop a plan that would prevent the denial and inaction of one nation from putting many other nations at risk of a pandemic of a deadly disease those   reforms were the result of failure in china  in the     sars outbreak  china‚Äôs ministry of health was aware for months of a dangerous new type of pneumonia in guangdong province before sharing that information with other nations or issuing a nationwide bulletin to hospitals and health professionals on preventing the spread of the disease  that virus spread to   countries  sickened thousands of people  and killed   before being brought under control in july    yet the revised who health regulations did not stop the chinese government from actively suppressing information that might have slowed or stopped the coronavirus outbreak  nor did it prevent many countries  including the us and canada  to ignore its warnings to conduct mass testing at an early stage before there was local transmission  the coronavirus is going to bring a reckoning in global health governance  we need a much stronger world health organization that can t be bullied by countries such as china and ignored by countries such as the u s  the world needs the globalization of public health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Left,https://capitalandmain.com,Will the Supreme Court Overrule Farmworker Union Rights?,not long before donald trump‚Äôs election in    the pacific legal foundation filed suit against california‚Äôs farmworker access rule in federal court on behalf of two companies ‚Äî cedar point nursery in siskiyou county and the fowler packing company in fresno  the foundation is a conservative libertarian group that holds property rights sacred and campaigns against racial equity  it fought hard for the appointment of amy coney barrett to the high court the access regulation  which took effect after the passage of the agricultural labor relations act in    allows union organizers to come onto a grower‚Äôs property in the morning before work to talk with workers  according to the labor board‚Äôs handbook  ‚Äúthe access regulations of the agricultural labor relations board are meant to insure that farm workers  who often may be contacted only at their work place  have an opportunity to be informed with minimal interruption of working activities ‚Äùall photos by david baconthe board requires that the union give notice to the employer before taking access  and that organizers not disrupt work  they can talk only for an hour before and after work and during lunch  and can take access for only a total of   days during a year growers have always hated the access rule  and many at first refused to obey  former united farm workers organizer fred ross jr  remembers being arrested several times in santa maria for taking access  ‚Äúthis was all about power and who had it ‚Äù he says  ‚Äúgrowers had it all  and their workers none  they wanted to dominate  for them  workers didn‚Äôt even have the right to talk ‚Äùthe suit filed by the plf  cedar point nursery v  hassid  attracted more than the predictable support of the california and american farm bureaus  amicus briefs came from a host of right wing legal bodies  including the mountain states and southeastern legal foundations  the pelican and cato institutes  and even the republican attorneys general of oklahoma  arizona  arkansas  kentucky  missouri  nebraska and texas  the company brief conjured up visions of ‚Äústampedes of third party organizers‚Äù and warned  ‚Äúif such a rule proliferates  property owners throughout much of the nation will see their rights greatly diminished as governments increasingly sanction invasions of their property ‚Äùhad the political atmosphere in the country not changed in the   years since the regulation has been in effect  the suit might never have been filed at all  agribusiness challenged the access rule from its inception and went all the way to the california supreme court  where the growers lost in    in the last decade  however  visions of a liberal u s  supreme court evaporated in the final years of the obama administration  and trump‚Äôs election led to the appointment of three right wing justices  giving the court a     conservative majority when the u s  supreme court agreed on nov    to hear the growers‚Äô appeal from their loss at the u s  court of appeals  many legal observers became concerned  ‚Äústate court decisions over state issues used to be respected by the u s  supreme court ‚Äù says jerry cohen  who helped write the law as the legal director for the ufw  ‚Äústates‚Äô rights used to be a republican issue  now the end product is all that matters ‚Äùthat end product is a continued erosion of power for farmworker unions  ‚Äúwithout the rule the union seems to workers like it‚Äôs not legitimate  and there really is no right to talk ‚Äù ross says  ‚Äúlosing it reinforces the growers‚Äô power and control  it‚Äôs one more blow to the right to organize ‚Äùthe mundane genesis of the current suit was a short strike in dorris  near the oregon border  where hundreds of farmworkers migrate from southern california every year to trim young strawberry plants  in    according to one worker  jessica rodriguez  the company paid low wages  had dirty bathrooms and harassed and intimidated workers  they called the united farm workers  which sent organizers and filed under the access rule to talk with them on the property  the strike lasted for just a day  at fowler packing the union filed for access to talk with an unrelated group of workers  and the company simply refused to let organizers onto the property over the years the access rule became a valuable tool for organizing workers  jerry cohen remembers his discussions with ufw founder cesar chavez  during negotiations with then gov  jerry brown  who signed the law during his first term in    ‚Äúcesar told us to get things that were practical  that could help workers organize ‚Äù he recalls  ‚Äúwhere workers are together it‚Äôs easier for the union to talk with them ‚Äùthe access regulation came into effect at a time when the ufw was strong  the balance of power between workers and growers had shifted  and by the early 1980s more than     farmworkers had union contracts  to eliseo medina  who grew up in a farmworker family and became a leading organizer  ‚Äúthe rule was a very clear example that growers were not all powerful  it was a huge change  people saw organizers coming onto the properties  and could have a conversation at work about their future  it gave people confidence that change was possible ‚Äùin    when a huge campaign began to organize the strawberry industry in watsonville  organizers visited picking crews in dozens of fields  they taped butcher paper on the walls of the porta potties  and held meetings where strawberry workers wrote down their demands for raising some of the lowest wages in agriculture  for health benefits and an end to discrimination in hiring  then in field meetings they planned marches to the company offices  where the demands were announced in   the access rule was used in mcfarland in the san joaquin valley  where workers angry over a wage cut went on strike  they called in ufw organizers  who used meetings in the fields during lunch and after work to collect signatures on an election petition  after workers voted overwhelmingly for the union  the blueberry pickers chose a ranch committee and eventually negotiated a contract with gourmet trading when pacific legal foundation argued its case in   before the u s  court of appeals for the ninth circuit  where it ultimately lost  its attorney wen fa declared  ‚Äúthe growers have no problem in the union talking with workers  it‚Äôs where they talk with the workers  ‚Ä¶  there are  plenty of alternative means for the union to talk with workers ‚Ä¶ all the workers  at cedar point nursery and fowler packing company  live in houses or hotels  many have cellphones ‚Äùthe alra had recognized  however  that it‚Äôs harder for farmworkers to organize than for other workers  and set up a much quicker process for gaining union recognition than the national labor relations act did for other workers in    because farmworkers work only for a season  which can last just weeks  union representation elections take place a week after workers petition for them  and within just   hours if there‚Äôs a strike growers are required to furnish a list of workers with addresses  ‚Äúthose lists are notoriously bad  though ‚Äù medina laughs  most cedar point workers actually live hundreds of miles from their seasonal jobs  addresses in mexico are very hard to find  and workers on this side of the border often live in isolated colonias scattered over a huge geographical area  ‚Äúby winning access it was easier to get their addresses so we could visit them  especially those who were afraid to talk in front of the foreman ‚Äù ross explains the difficulty of reaching workers outside of work is even greater for a growing segment of the farm labor workforce‚Äî those workers brought to the u s  under temporary h 2a visas  in   the u s  department of labor allowed california growers to fill     jobs with these contract laborers  ‚Äúh 2a workers would be even more impacted by losing the access rule ‚Äù medina charges  ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt have the legal right to organize ‚Äî even undocumented workers have more rights than h 2a workers  they‚Äôre living in barracks under the growers‚Äô   hour control  in delano growers are taking over whole motels and making them into labor camps ‚Äùthe union  however  has used the access rule less frequently over the years  in her defense of it  alrb chairwoman victoria hassid noted that it filed for access at only   of the     agricultural employers in california in    ‚Äúthere is no indication ‚Äù she wrote  ‚Äúthat the access regulation poses a significant problem for california farms ‚Ä¶ petitioners have not actually alleged any negative economic impact on them  or anyone else  resulting from the regulation ‚Äùpacific legal foundation‚Äôs wen fa made the growers‚Äô root argument in response  ‚Äúthe constitution forbids government from forcing property owners to allow unwanted strangers onto their property  and there is no exception for union activists ‚Äùin an interview with this author  fa claimed that growers‚Äô economic losses growing out of the access rule could be ‚Äúsignificant ‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt say specifically what they are  ‚Äúthis case is about property rights ‚Äù he said  in his winning defense of the access rule before the u s  court of appeals  matthew weiss  deputy attorney general for the alrb  noted that the effort to knock out the rule simply ‚Äúprivileges private property interests over all others ‚Äùufw general counsel mario martinez says the effort to knock out the access rule is further evidence of a history of racism toward farmworkers ‚Äúthe federal government has excluded farmworkers from all labor law protections under the national labor relations act for   years ‚Äù he charges  ‚Äúin light of this racially discriminatory exclusion  california granted to agricultural workers important labor protections to balance the historical imbalance of power between farmworkers and growers  a court review of california‚Äôs legislation appears to be another attempt to unfairly discriminate ‚Äùthe u s  supreme court plans to hear arguments in the case early next year and will probably rule by july,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Left,https://columbusfreepress.com,Kossuth Street Garden under attack by developer,the award winning neighborhood institution  kossuth street garden  ksg  is in grave danger a developer wants us to go away so he can build   expensive homes on   e kossuth street  but to succeed at this point  he needs changes approved by the city of columbus for zoning and variances  based on advice of our south side area commission the site of our majestic and beloved   year old award winning community garden was sold and the new developer now wants us out  as he will build   new  affordable homes  at      to      each and likely ask for tax abatements next spring  the land is zoned  commercial  and the developer needs a  residential  zoning change in order to build new owner tracy cohen  the carroll  ohio developer  offered to sell us the section where the garden green space is on october   this year but then on november    he went back on his promise  as that would impact his bottom line and decrease his profits we say a city can have a peaceful co existence between community gardens green space and developers if it is done with the steady  firm hand of socially conscientious zoning and urban planning this matter will be decided by columbus city council at their december      open meeting  we cite the   city of columbus study attached that states that whenever a farmer‚Äôs market or well maintained community garden is on a site proposed for a zoning change that great consideration be given to zoning in those  commonwealth  places ironically  three weeks ago  the kossuth street garden won the franklin park conservatory   growing to green  neighborhood impact garden of the year  with that came a commendation from columbus city council in its entirety and all three franklin county commissioners we need public support so we can move city council to implement their stated policy intentions from the   report  amongst many other reasons can the southern orchards civic association help on november   at the soca vote  the developer s proposed re zoning went down  but his three variances passed  voting was limited to dues paying members only  not unlike a poll tax  and thus the pool was only   people  the greatly impoverished wrote that they could not easily spare the dues  but wanted to have their voices heard soca was in agreement with the ksg proposal to hold back zoning changes until the developer commits to a peaceful co existence with the garden by selling the ksg the   feet by   section where our community gardens is located i ve been trying to get our by laws changed at the civic level to allow any resident of southern orchards to vote  our top leadership has not submitted the changes our by laws committee agreed upon in late february   to a vote  only one of our elected leadership went for the common sense solution proposed by the ksg we thank you  donna hughes  soca treasurer  you re a friend of smart  equitable urban planning through your vote with the ksg backgroundon october    we asked the developer if he would sell us the   foot by   foot area where the garden sits somewhat majestically he said that maybe we could find a public private partnership that would give him an offer we then dutifully contacted the obama foundation knowing that michelle obama s keystone is building and preserving community gardens  fitness and nutrition as a means of delivering on social justice promises the garden s board of advisers has many mutual friends with the obama family and await an answer as we have also sent emails to  share our strength   no kid hungry  and other local and national foundations as those outreach efforts were underway  a change of heart came from the developer we were asked to leave the property entirely with no date set but construction was planned for spring   on november    the developer offered us      to leave and try to find another plot but gardens are living organisms and not easily moved again  we told him that he would make more money in the long run with a beautiful garden and green space near his homes and that real estate studies show this to be true this has much to do with smart urban planning and zoning in green spaces community gardens next to housing developments it is forward thinking urban design nationwide children‚Äôs hospital  nch  has a garden that we had prior plans to assist folks in finally getting truly operational three blocks away and we had already reached out to tim mount  lead gardener at the nch ronald mcdonald house to aid that garden in   tim mount won  gardener of the year  from franklin park conservatory  growing to green  the same night last month that the ksg won  neighborhood improvement garden of the year there s that mutually beneficial equation again a recent study of columbus tree canopy and green space shows a distinct lack of such compared to cites such as cleveland  cincinnati  pittsburgh chicago and milwaukee once a green space is gone  it is gone for many decades into the future kossuth street garden historywe are much more than an award winning garden  we are a social justice and empowerment zone you may know we live and garden in an area that is third worst in the u s for black infant mortality and our garden has fought for proper nutrition  education and fitness for young mothers and at risk children  our programs are making a difference in that morbid statistic among the many other social justice issues we face and find solutions in no small way our partnerships through the years are impressive and we ve had more than   people volunteer here since we began in   we ve had  get out the vote  events every year and kids art  art   justice  this summer as families made yard signs touting social justice after the murder of george floyd we are largely an education garden teaching nutrition and science in a unique way but also find people jobs we also work with the franklin county juvenile court helping kids in the system get in their community service time and learn how to work in teams and give and receive respect we have cremains of area homicide victims in an attempt to heal families and our neighbors we also have memorials to fallen police  firefighters  community contributors  artists and activists such as emily noble  ruben castillo herrera and amber evans the adjoining green space is a safe place where neighbors meet and our new flower boxes help us grow bouquets which are brought to places that house and work with at risk children at huckleberry house  nationwide children s hospital  the reeb center and the homeless camps our garden is an after school safe zone for kids as they learned math and science skills from our qualified staff our  little library  was one of the first on the south side and is a source of cherished and sometimes elusive happiness for kids who may not own anything of their own we are much more than a garden  as you can see how you can helpat the top  this is request that you write columbus city council before december      and if you live on the south side  south side area commission  ssac  before their meeting on november   ask that they implement the advice of the city of the columbus   study  go to this city of columbus webpage  scroll to the bottom and download the report  and find a way to zone us in to a developer s plans as is done in many other major u s  cities with great value to both the community and with value added to a development that incorporates green space and commonwealth grounds the point is we can indeed have both an award winning garden and a wonderful housing development where both entities benefit and thus the city of columbus and citizens are mutually aided we don t live in a binary world  we see it as a win win for all involved for legal standing  we point to the ohio supreme court case duncan v middlefield twp that states that community needs can take precedent over a developer‚Äôs housing plans

exposed to systematic expulsion in    the oakland institute found that institutional investors  including hedge funds  private equity and pension funds  are eager to capitalise on global farmland as a new and highly desirable asset class  financial returns are what matter to these entities  not food security consider ukraine  the organisation grain found that in   small farmers operated    of agricultural land in that country  but provided    of agricultural output  including     of potatoes     of honey     of vegetables     of fruits and berries and    of milk  it is clear that ukraine‚Äôs small farms were delivering impressive outputs following the toppling of ukraine‚Äôs government in early    the way was paved for foreign investors and western agribusiness to take a firm hold over the agri food sector  reforms mandated by the eu backed loan to ukraine in   included agricultural deregulation intended to benefit foreign agribusiness  natural resource and land policy shifts were being designed to facilitate the foreign corporate takeover of enormous tracts of land frederic mousseau  policy director at the oakland institute  stated at the time that the world bank and imf were intent on opening up foreign markets to western corporations and that the high stakes around the control of ukraine‚Äôs vast agricultural sector  the world‚Äôs third largest exporter of corn and fifth largest exporter of wheat  constitute an overlooked critical factor  he added that in recent years  foreign corporations had acquired more than     million hectares of ukrainian land western agribusiness has been coveting ukraine‚Äôs agriculture sector for quite some time  long before the coup  that country contains one third of all arable land in europe  an article by oriental review in   noted that since the mid 90s the ukrainian americans at the helm of the us ukraine business council had been instrumental in encouraging the foreign control of ukrainian agriculture in november    the ukrainian agrarian confederation drafted a legal amendment that would benefit global agribusiness producers by allowing the widespread use of genetically modified seeds  when gmo crops were legally introduced into the ukrainian market in    they were planted in up to    of all soybean fields       of cornfields and over    of all sunflower fields  according to various estimates  or

‚Äì pools of money that use pension funds  sovereign wealth funds  endowment funds and investments from governments  banks  insurance companies and high net worth individuals ‚Äì are being injected into the agriculture sector throughout the world  this money is used to lease or buy up farms on the cheap and aggregate them into large scale  us style grain and soybean concerns  the article outlines how offshore tax havens and the european bank for reconstruction and development  ebrd  has targeted ukraine in addition to various western governments  the bill and melinda gates foundation trust  which manages the foundation‚Äôs endowment  is also investing in private equity  taking positions in farm and food businesses around the world grain notes that this forms part of the trend whereby the world of finance ‚Äì banks  funds  insurance companies and the like ‚Äì is gaining control over the real economy  including forests  watersheds and rural people‚Äôs territories apart from uprooting communities and grabbing resources to entrench an industrial  export oriented model of agriculture  this process of ‚Äòfinancialisation‚Äô is shifting power to remote board rooms occupied by people with no connection to farming and who are merely in it to make money  these funds tend to invest for a     year period  resulting in handsome returns for investors but can leave a trail of long term environmental and social devastation and serve to undermine local and regional food insecurity this financialisation of agriculture perpetuates a model of farming that serves the interests of the agrochemical and seed giants  including one of the world‚Äôs biggest companies  cargill  which is involved in almost every aspect of global agribusiness still run as a privately held company  the   year old enterprise trades in purchasing and distributing various agricultural commodities  raises livestock and produces animal feed as well as food ingredients for application in processed foods and

Left,http://libcom.org,Undercover Research Group: The Fifteen Questions We Work With,a short guide from the undercover research group listing some of the key questions that they ask when investigating suspected undercover officers as we noted in a recent blogpost on how we work  we have a list of questions that we have developed from close study of the undercovers exposed so far  if someone comes to us with a suspicion about someone in their group  we put these questions to them  to see whether their suspicions are well founded  if many boxes are ticked  there are strong grounds for further investigation here we set out the questions we work with  putting them context  thanks for people taking part in our meeting at the london anarchist bookfair for their input  some questions are specifically related to the undercover tradecraft  others are things about what infiltrating officers get wrong  or what we‚Äôve picked up from our own analyses   is their background missing generally  the undercover has very little in the way of background story  they will often have a ‚Äòlegend‚Äô ‚Äì where they are from  why they left  details will generally be quite sparse  and there is very little overlap between their previous world and their activist one  it is rare to meet friends  or see their photos  from their ‚Äòprevious‚Äô life  even though they may be discussed or the suspect claims he goes to see them  undercovers will also have a lack of presence in the public record  though this is not always obvious until one starts investigating them seriously caveat  it is known that several undercovers did bring other people through ‚Äì generally these are considered ‚Äòbackground artistes‚Äô used to help bolster an undercover‚Äôs story  for example  lynn watson introduced several boyfriends to activist friends  generally these other people have only appeared once or twice  and at times have been noted for their unusual or provocative behaviour   is their politics missing  underdeveloped or stereotyped related to the first question  in most cases undercovers have had very little to say in relation to the politics of the movement they are infiltrating  although they are indeed interested in listening to others  though some eschewed any interest in the name of cynicism  they contribute little on that score and generally avoid or head off such discussions  where they demonstrate interest  it is often superficial and the books and background material they have are standard  popular stuff showing little depth or breathe caveat  clearly this can be applied to a lot of campaigners  but in some groups it is a reason for standing out   has anyone ever met their family some undercovers never talk about their family  while some talk about them a lot  however opportunities to meet them never quite come off ‚Äì there are always excuses  undercovers can produce photos and other material indicating the existence of supposed family members  and talk about having close relationships with them  others have spun stories about abusive relationships  and used these stories to build trust  but inconsistently talk about how they are going to see them  sometimes family crises  such as a seriously ill father  are used as an excuse to go away for extended periods of time   does their job take them away for periods at a time it appears that many undercovers have jobs that require them to be away for extended periods of time  up to several weeks at a time  these jobs would also supply them with money  vehicles and excuses to put receipts ‚Äòthrough the books‚Äô  depending on the nature of the job  most are reluctant to bring activists into contact with their employers  e g  lynn watson was a care worker  but when friends asked about working with her agency  she kept them at bay  did their home look un lived in a common theme is how un homely or not lived in their houses were  though ‚Äì again ‚Äì not in every case  there would be materials around that indicated ‚Äòpolitical activist‚Äô  but they are the exception rather than the norm  looking more staged than anything  there would also be a lack of personal touch and possessions  the most noted case of this was lynn watson‚Äôs house which had overdone class war posters and little in the way of personal touch   did they have a vehicle most undercovers had vehicles and showed willing to use them for the purposes of campaigning  including doing reconnaissances and actions  the vehicles would vary in type and model  and include vans  sometimes the undercovers claimed the car came through their work   did they have above average driving skills something commented on a lot of undercovers is their above average driving skills  which is not unsurprising given special branch   police background   would you consider them someone who went out of their way to be helpful the charm  friendliness and general kindness of the undercovers is regularly noted upon  they come across as ready to go out of their way to help  in particular  they are happy to give lifts to and from campaigner‚Äôs homes   did they have ready access to money and were they generous with it they are often ready to help people out with money  such as wave petrol costs or buy rounds of food or drink  sometimes they will claim that expenses are already covered it in some way ‚Äì through their work for instance  they are not necessarily flash  but seem to have ready access to cash  they show willing to be generous  and will be quick to buy the rounds   did they focus relationships on key people it is not uncommon for them to ‚Äì after getting involved in a group ‚Äì to ‚Äòmake a beeline‚Äô for key people and become very close to them personally and in campaigning  this often leads to them being been seen as ‚Äòsecond in command‚Äô  etc   did they ever exhibit noticeable out of character behaviour a number of undercovers have been known to do something quite out of character that either disrupted an action and alerted police  or was distinctively away from the norm of the group  examples are  inexplicable carelessness  jim boyling sabotaged a blockade during a reclaim the streets action by ‚Äò forgetting‚Äô to keep window closed  so that the car was easy to remove by the police  or doing things beyond the group‚Äôs normal mode of behaviour  encouraging activities that put other members at risk  or take them into unplanned confrontations related to this is spreading stories about more serious involvement in radical action elsewhere to give the impression they are ‚Äòup for it‚Äô  though this would differ from how they normally present and actually behave in given situations   have you spotted oddities a number of things we have encountered in our research  that are worth noting if you encounter them   have documents in other names  sometimes can be explained away  not all are without good reason   organisational skills at odds with their persona   not having the skills they claim  especially where it is within their alleged job  mark jenner  for instance claimed to be a professional joiner but was unable to fit a kitchen  related to this is not knowing enough about something they claim to be into  particularly a football team   a focus on cleanliness and order that puts them at the far end of the activist spectrum  or at odds with it  e g  mark kennedy getting his hair regularly styled in professional hairdressers   characteristics that indicate some formal training  the way they do their boots   reacting to surprise situations in ways that indicated some other training  at a noise outside jenner dropping in the correct moves to react to a bomb explosion   owning a very expensive bit of equipment that is somewhat out of characteristic for them or their milieu  top of the range phone  watch   doing something that seems to be signalling to someone else   have there been weird things around court cases or ‚Äì lack of ‚Äì police interest sometimes undercover officers have been dropped inexplicably from a legal case  or chose to have a different solicitor from everyone else  or you may have experienced a noticeable lack of police interest during the period the undercover was part of your group  or people would not be arrested when it would be otherwise be expected it is now known that the undercovers‚Äô handlers were turning a blind eye to illegal activities at occasions  and would go out of their way to keep the undercover from going to court caveat  the opposite might be true too  there are several strong examples of undercovers turning up in court using their false names to give evidence for instance ‚Äì leading to overturned convictions eventually   did he or she suddenly disappear and cut off all contact this question is a section in itself as the ‚Äòexit strategy‚Äô is one of the most important aspects of the tradecraft when investigating a suspicion  in every case  undercovers have served a term of four to five years  then left relatively abruptly  it is quite telling how time and again two strategies are used  sometimes in combination  a  they go abroad  or b  act out and demonstrate a kind of mental breakdown  including actual tears  more importantly  they disappear completely  totally cutting off from their activist social life in several cases  not attending funerals or coming to other events related to people they were once very close to  gave rise to suspicions sometimes  the situation has been more complicated  because the undercover continued to tangle up their personal life and their professional undercover one  which is called ‚Äògoing native‚Äô  mike chitty  for instance  returned after supposedly having left for canada to socialise with activist friends  while he continued his job in the protective service ‚Äì a different section of spacial branch  kennedy came back after he had left the police  and tried to use his activist contacts to set up shop as a corporate spy selling the information he gathered   can you help us kill these myths we are aware from conversations that some people believe or have believed undercovers had a code of conduct  that there were things they would not do  we flag them up here to put an end to these myths   commit illegal activities   have sexual relationships with people they were targeting   deny they are police when asked directly  some would even joke about it we now know that all of these things have been done regularly by undercover officers important caveats if you find someone whose story ticks a number of these boxes  it does not necessarily mean you are dealing with an undercover officer  it merely means that your suspicions warrant further digging and investigating  these questions are a starting point  not an end in themselves to proof a case we strongly discourage people from spreading rumours based on suspicions alone  and recommend following up with research and proceeding with that as quickly as possible  gossiping without confirmation can do much harm and destroy groups from within  regardless of the actual infiltration it is important to remember that while there might be commonalities among the way undercovers operate  there are as many differences  particularly around what they seek to achieve  some directly facilitate a group  while others seek to destroy it  for instance we also note that there are many good reasons for people to fall into the same categories without being an undercover  our framework is not fail safe  for example  there are pretty valid reasons for not having contact with your family  or for people to disappear  suffering from burn out is too common a reason for activists to withdraw  for instance  which should not happen in the first place ‚Äì but that is another story  for support contact counselling for social change furthermore  not all undercover stories are exactly the same  there will be variations  so not fitting the pattern does not necessarily put someone in the clear either  apart from that  other forms of infiltration  by security services or corporations  or through informers  will have very different patterns  if you have any questions or concerns or want to run unusual situations by us  do get in contact n b  if you post these questions anywhere  please leave the caveats in place final notethe nature of this work means all our experience and research is about historical undercovers  all prior to   and all about those who have been extracted from their role  as this tradecraft is exposed  the police will have to change tactics to some degree furthermore  the growing use of social media makes it more and more impossible to enter into a scene without any traces of a past  another part of one‚Äôs life and without family  though we know the police are actively looking into building ‚Äòonline legends‚Äô to deal with this problem this article is here to help those who have been targeted in the past to identify individuals who should be investigated further  and should not be seen as the most up to date understanding of undercover police tradecraft profiles of undercovers mentioned in

deeply humiliating  she and her husband denis were invited to the scottish castle by queen elizabeth ii  it was an initiation of sorts for the new leader  in one embarrassing incident  thatcher  dressed in a cobalt blue suit  joined the queen stalking  only to be met by sniggers  at least  this is how the weekend is presented in the new series of the crown  ‚Äúi‚Äôm struggling to find any redeeming features in these people at all ‚Äù gillian anderson s thatcher says to denis  ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt sophisticated or cultured or elegant or anything close to an ideal ‚Äùfor royal commentators  this scene is one of the most offensive in the series  and there are plenty more  across the country  those that remember the 1980s have been left either appalled or wistful  sometimes in equal measure  by the latest re enactment of the queen‚Äôs relationship with thatcher  these are faces and events that are still controversial in the uk  our unresolved national traumas  the troubles in northern ireland  the austerity of thatcherism and the royal family‚Äôs treatment of princess diana  make it a tantalising  if not difficult  watch  see also  princess diana and margaret thatcher reinvigorate the crown it is unsurprising that this season  the fourth and the closest yet to the world of today  has received a special kind of backlash  the show‚Äôs writer peter morgan told the sunday times he tried his ‚Äúvery  very best to get it right‚Äù  adding  ‚Äúyou sometimes have to forsake accuracy   you must never forsake truth ‚Äù rarely has our recent history been dramatised with such an emphasis on ‚Äútruth‚Äù  and yet it seems hard to agree on exactly what that is some of the complaints have been niche  michael fagan  the man who broke into buckingham palace in    disputes many of the show s depictions  not least that he is much ‚Äúbetter looking‚Äù than the actor who plays him  a telegraph reader complained  ‚Äútwo things caused concern  first  the queen never  ever delivered a cocked wrist salute  second  why on earth is her headdress adorned with what appears to be the welsh guards‚Äô plume ‚Äù one viewer told slate  ‚Äúthe fishing scene  for anybody who has ever been fishing  frankly  it‚Äôs ridiculous  they literally just get everything wrong ‚Äù horse and hound readers were equally outraged  why wasn‚Äôt princess anne warming up her horse before her equestrian event but for members of thatcher‚Äôs government  the way the crown dramatised the political events of the 1980s was anything but funny  after watching three episodes of the series  former deputy chairman of the conservative party jeffrey archer told me  ‚Äúin the case of margaret  in particular  it is nothing less than farcical to suggest she didn t hold the queen in high regard  my wife and i used to see her regularly after she resigned  usually in the evening or sunday  i can tell you  there was a picture in a silver frame of the queen mother in her drawing room  it doesn t add up  there‚Äôs been a lot written about margaret thatcher‚Äôs relationship with the queen over the years and of course  i had no idea what it was  as i wasn t in the room for those weekly meetings  she never talked about them  that wasn‚Äôt her style  but if the queen s name arose  complete respect immediately followed ‚Äúironically  it was after her death that the queen and duke of edinburgh paid margaret the great compliment of being present at her funeral ‚Äù archer adds  ‚Äúan honour no one had received since the death of winston churchill ‚Äùroyal biographer penny junor thinks the latest series is the least accurate so far and believes the blame falls on the show‚Äôs limited access to sources  ‚Äúthe reason this one is so much more inaccurate is because we only have diana‚Äôs side of the story from her various interviews  but it was very subjective ‚Äù junor says  ‚Äúthere are no other records of this marriage  charles has never spoken about it  camilla has never spoken about it  the only voice is diana s ‚Äù see also  forget the crown  itv‚Äôs endeavour is the period drama for our time others have also disputed the show‚Äôs version of events  after watching an episode  the former conservative mp nicholas soames  also a former equerry to prince charles  tweeted that he was ‚Äútruly appalled at the deliberate mischief making  lies and meanness ‚Äù of the show  which was ‚Äúclearly intended to be a vile misrepresentation of the royal family‚Äù  the journalist and broadcaster andrew neil says there was no evidence that in   the royal press secretary michael shea ‚Äúleaked at her majesty‚Äôs behest‚Äù  neil says he was approached by producers of the crown  and asked to give his account of the rift between thatcher and the queen  as sunday times editor  but neil laments that he did not get a more prominent showing in the series  ‚Äúperhaps morgan was worried the facts might get in the way of his ‚Äòdramatic licence ‚Äù he writes in the sunday times  ‚Äúwhich sometimes turns out to be a fancy phrase for ‚Äòmaking things up britain is a country obsessed with its postwar history  the crown is simply another symptom of our national brooding  but what purpose does it serve  for archer  the answer is simple  ‚Äúi suppose they consider it makes good television ‚Äù to those that weren‚Äôt around in the eighties  the crown is a seductive retelling of

million voters was our record set in   ‚Äùhe said      of active registered voters have participated  with that percentage expected to increase before all the votes are counted  the record active voter participation of    was established in   he added that the record for overall eligible voter population voting was set in   with      engaging in the process  that number could be in danger as well  but it will be a couple of weeks before official final totals will be known ‚Äúnothing is ultimately certified statewide until nov     which is when we do the statewide canvass with certification of results ‚Äù lee said  ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have some preliminary numbers in the next couple of days  but that‚Äôs when we‚Äôll know the final numbers ‚Äùhe said that while the covid   outbreak did prompt increased mail in voting  the number of people choosing vote by mail had already been growing steadily over the years ‚Äúwe would have been voting by mail even if there wasn‚Äôt a pandemic  that‚Äôs the way we would have been voting ‚Äù he said  ‚Äúthis turnout shows that vote by mail really works well  so in the future people have more confidence in the system ‚Äùutahns who did not vote by mail lined up at designated polling locations throughout the state tuesday  meanwhile  some downtown businesses boarded up windows and planned to close early in case of any potential civil unrest capt  tanner jensen  director of the statewide information and analysis center  a branch of the department of public safety  said the tense political climate that plagued utah and the country this summer had officials ready to combat a number of potential threats ‚Äî whether that was people tampering with election systems  demonstrations boiling out of control  or a single person looking to ‚Äúmake a statement in a violent manner ‚Äù he said ‚Äúwe really have been dealing with the demonstrator versus counterdemonstrator  which sometimes can become confrontational  so that‚Äôs kind of our

you know  stay home  stay safe ‚Äùsalt lake police sgt  keith horrocks said officers kept a low profile near polling locations tuesday so as not to incite any reactions simply by their presence ‚Äúwe met with the aclu  we also met with the county recorder  and speaking with them it was determined that the best practice is that you don‚Äôt really have a uniformed law enforcement officer at the polls  because there are folks that are going to vote where that could cause an intimidation factor ‚Äù horrocks said ‚Äúbut behind the scenes there is a lot going on ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre ready if something happens ‚Äùthere was a small gathering near the salt lake county government center on state street  where a group of trump supporters and black lives matter protesters organized on opposite streets from each other  although there were reports of several armed protesters on both sides  horrocks said tuesday was relatively quiet ‚Äúour folks went down there and chatted with them and made sure they were   feet from the polling location  which they were ‚Äù he said  ‚Äúwe‚Äôre happy that so far today it‚Äôs been peaceful ‚Äùhorrocks noted that salt lake police have had a lot of practice this year

the sheriff‚Äôs office is investigating reports of a volunteer poll worker turning voters away at the county administration building  according to a statement issued tuesday night  police say initial information suggests it was a miscommunication between the poll worker and a voter physical threats to election security weren‚Äôt the only thing the utah department of public safety had to prepare for  and cybersecurity was an equally important aspect  jensen says he has confidence in the state‚Äôs election cybersecurity  misinformation  however  is something he says increasingly ‚Äúcauses concern and distrust  sows discord among voters ‚Äù‚Äúwe ask that you use websites that are trusted   media sites that are trusted as well to get your information during the election ‚Äù jensen said leading up to election day     of approximately     million registered voters in the beehive state had already cast their ballots  lee said  and scores more voted in person ‚Äúright now  we‚Äôre at       processed and there‚Äôs obviously thousands more in the mail and people voting in the polling places today ‚Äù lee said tuesday  ‚Äúwe have more coming in and at this point  i‚Äôll be shocked if we don‚Äôt break every kind of record for voting in utah ‚Äùhe said    of registered voters participated in    the most in recent history  the state record for percentage of voter turnout was in   for

collected the transmission rate predicts the average number of people who will be infected by each person already carrying the disease a transmission rate below   for the virus means ‚Äúyou get fewer
